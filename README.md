Evan's Digital LEGO Models
==========================
These are models that I have built using:
* [LEGO(R) Digital Designer (LDD)](http://ldd.lego.com/)
* [LeoCAD](http://www.leocad.org/).

This repository will only include models (or portions of models) that have
corresponding LDD/[LDraw](http://www.ldraw.org/) compatible files. Free-hand
models will not be posted here.


File Formats
------------
Each folder in this repository will include, at the minimum:
* README - A description of each model
* PNG    - A picture of the model
* LXF    - Used by LDD compatible software
* LDR    - Used by LDraw compatible software (as outlined in the
[LDraw File Format Standard](http://www.ldraw.org/article/218.html))
* XML    - Used by [Bricklink](http://www.bricklink.com/) for mass upload


How I Generate These Files
--------------------------
I generate LDD files (.lxf) files from LDD.

I generate LDraw files (.ldr) from LDD, so they should be compatible in that
regard. Not every piece is available between LDD and LDraw libraries. As such,
LDraw models may be missing some pieces when loaded by LDraw compatible
software.

I generate Bricklink XML files (.xml) from either
[LeoCAD](http://www.leocad.org/) or
[BrickUtils](http://sourceforge.net/projects/brickutils/). XML files are not
gauranteed to have a complete list of parts for a model because of part library
differences between libraries.
